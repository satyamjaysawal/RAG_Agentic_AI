Title: About — Eleven Madison Park
Content:
Welcome to Eleven Madison Park Eleven Madison Park is a fine dining restaurant in the heart of New York City. Overlooking Madison Square Park–one of Manhattan’s most beautiful green spaces–we sit at the base of a historic Art Deco building on the corner of East 24th Street and Madison Avenue. Since opening in 1998, we underwent a full-scale renovation and redesign in the summer of 2017. Chef Daniel Humm has owned the restaurant since 2011, during which time we have evolved considerably in both cuisine and experience. In 2021, we transitioned to a fully plant-based menu, using no animal products. That same year, we partnered with Magic Farms , which grows produce exclusively for our seasonal menus. Guests can enjoy a full tasting menu, a five-course menu, or a bar menu. The bar also offers à la carte snacks, as well as wine and cocktails. Reservations are available via Resy , and bar seating is open for both walk-ins and reservations. Hours: Monday to Wednesday: 5:30 pm to 10 pm Thursday to Friday: 5 pm to 11 pm Saturday: 12 pm to 2 pm, 5 pm to 11 pm Sunday: 12 pm to 2 pm, 5 pm to 11 pm View Wine List View Cocktail List Due to the hyper-seasonal nature of our menu, all courses are subject to change. Therefore, we do not share our food menus online. Book on Resy

Title: Magic Farms — Eleven Madison Park
Content:
About Magic Farms As part of our transition to a plant-based menu, it was important for us to build a deeper connection to the ingredients we use in our kitchen. In 2021, we partnered with Chef Daniel Humm’s friend, Maciek Kobielski, to create Magic Farms on his family’s land in Hoosick Falls, New York. What began as a passion project for Maciek has become a full-time career. The farm now spans four acres of fields and seven high tunnels, growing produce exclusively for our seasonal menus. At the restaurant, this partnership has profoundly influenced our craft, fostering an ongoing dialogue between chef and farmer that shapes every menu. Our team collaborates with Maciek to plan menus around his harvest cycles and crop rotations, mapping out seasons in advance. Maciek grows each vegetable to our specifications using pesticide-free, regenerative techniques, with harvests peaking in the warmer months. This ensures access to the freshest, most flavorful produce year-round and allows each menu to reflect the best of the Northeast’s seasons.

Daniel Humm is a chef, author, speaker, and owner of Daniel Humm Hospitality , the New York-based hospitality group behind the highly acclaimed Eleven Madison Park, Clemente Bar , and direct-to-consumer lifestyle brand Eleven Madison Home . A native of Switzerland, Chef Humm earned his first Michelin star at the age of 24. He is consistently listed as one of the world’s best chefs, with both he and Eleven Madison Park receiving numerous accolades: four stars from The New York Times, seven James Beard Foundation Awards (including Outstanding Chef and Outstanding Restaurant in America), a number one spot on the world’s 50 Best Restaurants list, and three Michelin stars for over 12 years in a row, since 2012. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chef Humm transformed Eleven Madison Park’s Michelin-starred restaurant and its back-of-house into a commissary kitchen in partnership with Rethink Food , a not-for-profit organization co-founded by Chef Humm. He and his team prepared over 1,000,000 meals over the course of the pandemic for frontline workers and underserved communities and distributed them to churches, shelters, and food banks. In 2021, he reopened Eleven Madison Park with a completely plant-based menu and became the first and only plant-based restaurant in Michelin Guide history to receive a three-star rating in October 2022. Gwendal Poullennec, the International Director of the Michelin Guides, has called Chef Humm and Eleven Madison Park a North Star that young chefs can fix their eyes upon as they navigate their gastronomic journey. Chef Humm uses his global platform to advocate for equitable, sustainable food systems. He wants to inspire people both within and beyond the fine-dining world and build awareness around the transformative power of food. As a leading figure in the culinary realm, he ignited a conversation about challenging the definition of luxury in the food world and how it can be more purpose-driven at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. He discussed the impact of our food systems on the environment at the 2023’s Global Citizen Summit, joining activists and world leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Macron in setting a global agenda for action on the most urgent issues facing humanity and the planet. In September 2024, he was appointed UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Food Education by Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO’s Director-General. Chef Humm is the author of Eleven Madison Park: The Cookbook , I Love New York: Ingredients and Recipes , The NoMad Cookbook, Eleven Madison Park: The Next Chapter , and Eat More Plants . His latest book, titled Eleven Madison Park: The Plant-Based Chapter , was released in November 2024. Dominique Roy’s passion for cooking began at a young age, baking bread alongside his mother in his hometown of Gatineau, Canada. After attending culinary school at 17 and pastry school at 19, Dom worked for renowned chefs in Canada and France, including Georges Blanc and Jerome Ferrer. He participated in many different cooking competitions, including representing Team Canada in the Luxembourg Culinary World Cup in 2014. Dom always knew he wanted to work for one of the best restaurants in the world, and after staging at Maaemo in Oslo and Mirazur in France, he arrived in New York City from Montréal. He started with Eleven Madison Park in 2015, holding various positions, including Sous Chef and Culinary Research & Development. He also led the opening team of Davies & Brook in London in 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Dom spearheaded the Eleven Madison Park and Rethink Food partnership, leading the program that provided hundreds of thousands of meals to both food-insecure residents of New York City as well as frontline workers. In 2021, he assumed the title of Chef de Cuisine, leading the reopening and building the vision for EMP’s future, and in 2023 he became a partner at Daniel Humm Hospitality. Laura Cronin grew up having a love for food at an early age, working in bakeries in her hometown of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. After graduating culinary school at Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, she moved across the country to pursue a career on the baking team at the San Francisco Baking Institute under the tutelage of Michel Suas. A year later, Laura relocated to Paris and enrolled at the Ecole Gregoire-Ferrandi, which led to an apprenticeship with Chef Angelo Musa. In 2011, Laura moved back to the States and worked in several restaurants including Zero Zero and Perbacco, where she was named San Francisco Chronicle’s Rising Star Chef and Zagat’s 30 under 30 list. In 2017, Laura moved to New York City to join the Eleven Madison Park team as a Pastry Sous Chef leading the team through the restaurant’s reopening and working closely with Executive Pastry Chef Mark Welker, she assumed the Pastry Chef role in 2019. Originally from New Jersey, Daniel DiStefano is the Executive Culinary Director for Daniel Humm Hospitality. Danny joined the team in 2009, starting as a commis and working his way up to sous chef in 2011. He has been instrumental in launching brands such as Made Nice and Eleven Madison Home. Following the pandemic, Danny returned as a Managing Partner to spearhead our at-home program and strategic partnerships, and in 2024, Danny assumed the role of Executive Culinary Director. In this role, he leads culinary operations and works closely with Chef Humm and the rest of the culinary development team on menus, partnerships, events, collaborations, and new projects. Josh Harnden was born in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised with a plant-based diet, which fueled his passion for food and the culinary arts from a young age. Immersed in the restaurant industry for over two decades, he worked his way through the Seattle culinary scene—including at the renowned Canlis—before moving to New York in 2011 to help open and manage Chef Daniel Humm’s restaurant at NoMad Hotel. After helping NoMad earn its first Michelin star, Josh was asked to join the team at Eleven Madison Park, where he has held a number of different management positions, including leading research and development. In this role, he helped to launch a range of pop-ups and openings for Daniel Humm Hospitality, as well as developing recipes for the NoMad and Eleven Madison Park cookbooks, including this one. He is now a partner and the Creative Culinary Director for Daniel Humm Hospitality. Andrew Chandler was essentially born into restaurants, spending much of his childhood watching his mother command the dining rooms of some of the best restaurants in his home state of Wisconsin. He followed in her footsteps, taking on his first jobs bussing tables and washing dishes as a teenager. After high school, he graduated from University of Wisconsin-Platteville with a bachelor’s degree in Psychology. He went on to spend several years working with children with special needs, while simultaneously working full time in some of the best restaurants in Milwaukee, including Riversite and Braise. Eventually it became clear that his true calling was working in the dining room, and in 2012 he moved across the country to start as a Kitchen Server at Eleven Madison Park. Andrew has worked through nearly every position in the restaurant, making the transition to management in 2016. Within Make it Nice he has led the team through the pop-up EMP Summer House, the subsequent reopening of Eleven Madison Park, and the opening of Davies and Brook in London.

Today, he leads the team as our General Manager. Our Wine Director, Adam Waddell, was born and raised on the West Coast, where he started violin studies at the age of four. After coming to New York in 2010 to continue studies in Classical Violin Performance, he soon developed a new-found passion for wine and hospitality.
